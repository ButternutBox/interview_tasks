# Butternut Box Engineering Tasks

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ldhg5acsz/image/upload/Web/photos/logos/butternut-logo-top.png)

This repository hosts documentation and starter code for the coding tasks we use in the Engineering team interview process at Butternut Box. These tasks are designed to resemble features we would build as part of our day-to-day, so that you can get a sense of what it's like here.

Start by reading the Readme in your project's directory. Then, you can clone the folder which includes some boilerplate code to help you get started with your task. Feel free to edit as much as you want, use the tools that are set up (or not) or even start from scratch if you prefer. We'd love to hear any questions or comments you might have in the process.
